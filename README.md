# Java Power-Up Chess


## Project Description
Users can play a modified version of the classic chess game through this Java-based power-up chess game. Apart from the standard gameplay, players have the chance to land on randomized power-up squares that activate one of four random power-ups. The game provides a user-friendly interface and the ability to save progress.

## Demo
### Power-Ups Explained
#### Random Promotion - A random pawn is randomly promoted to a Knight, Rook, Bishop, or Queen.
#### Move Piece Again - You must move the same piece a second time.
#### Choose Opponent's Piece - You choose which piece your opponent must move on next turn.
#### Pawn Guarde - Empty default pawn locations are refilled with a full army of pawns. Any pawns elsewhere on the board, remain.
